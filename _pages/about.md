Hi, I'm Norman, Renhao Zhang (张仁浩), currently a Computer Science PhD student in [Autonomous Learning Laboratory](https://all.cs.umass.edu/) at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), advised by [Professor Bruno Castro da Silva](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~bsilva/). 

My current research mainly sits at **Embodied AI**, particularly, **reinforcement learning** and **robotics**. Besides, I'm also interested in **multimodal learning**, **generative model**, **computer vision**, and **large language modal**, I have ideas and projects in these areas from time to time.

I got my master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), working on reinforcement learning with [Prof. George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/) in [Intelligent Robot Lab](http://irl.cs.brown.edu/) and computer graphics with [Prof. Daniel Ritchie](https://dritchie.github.io/) in [Brown Visual Computing Group](https://visual.cs.brown.edu/). Previously, I was cross-registered at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) during 2023 fall, working on an AI in healthcare project with [Prof. Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/). Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Information Engineering in [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Xuanheng Li](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/2018011001/en/index.htm) on applications of RL in wireless communication settings and Prof. [Shenglan Liu](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/liushenglan/en/index.htm) on computer vision.
