Hi, I'm Renhao Zhang! I'm an incoming Computer Science PhD student in [Autonomous Learning Laboratory](https://all.cs.umass.edu/) at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). I'm currently a master's student majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) (expected to graduate in May 2024). Previously, I was cross-registered for Computer Science at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) during 2023 fall. Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Information Engineering in [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/).

My research mainly sits at **reinforcement learning**, **generative model**, **computer vision**, **computer graphics** and **robotics**. In my master's study, I've been working with [Prof. George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/) in [Intelligent Robot Lab](http://irl.cs.brown.edu/) and [Prof. Daniel Ritchie](https://dritchie.github.io/) in [Brown Visual Computing Group](https://visual.cs.brown.edu/) at Brown University, and with [Prof. Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/) during my visit at Harvard University. Before that, I was advised by Prof. [Shenglan Liu](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/liushenglan/en/index.htm) and Prof. [Xuanheng Li](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/2018011001/en/index.htm) at Dalian University of Technology.
