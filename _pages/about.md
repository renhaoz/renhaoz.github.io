Hi, I'm Renhao Zhang! I'm an incoming Computer Science PhD student in [Autonomous Learning Laboratory](https://all.cs.umass.edu/) at [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). I'm currently a master's student majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) (expected to graduate in May 2024). Previously, I was cross-registered for Computer Science at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) during 2023 fall semester. Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Information Engineering in [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/).

My research mainly sits at **reinforcement learning**, **generative model**, **computer vision**, **computer graphics** and **robotics**. In my master's study, I've been working with [Prof. George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/) in [Intelligent Robot Lab](http://irl.cs.brown.edu/) to explore the intersection of model-based RL and hierarchical RL. Besides, I've also been working with [Prof. Daniel Ritchie](https://dritchie.github.io/) in [Brown Visual Computing](https://visual.cs.brown.edu/) group to do symbolic program inference from vision shapes with a recursive editing model. During my cross-registration in Harvard, I worked with [Prof. Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/) to use hierarchical imitation learning to interpret an [ICU dataset](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/).

Before joining Brown, I mainly focused on the application of RL and CV in science and engineering field. In RL, I used multi-agent DRL algorithms to allocate energy and spectrum resources for IoT devices in a 6G wireless communication setting, also used DRL to do dynamic spectrum access. In CV, I conducted several projects about detecting niduses on CT images, and identifying motions in figure skating in HPC lab of DUT. Besides, I have participated in the development of *Face Recognition based Time and Attendance System* as an algorithm engineer intern at Panasonic Corp., and *Recognition of Japanese cursive script* as an AI Lab researcher intern at Dalian Hi-think Computer Technology Corp, where I combined CNN and Transformer to detect and recognize cursive Japanese characters.
