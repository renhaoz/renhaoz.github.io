Hi, I'm Renhao Zhang! I'm a master's student majored in computer engineering in [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) (expected to graduate in May 2024), and I'm now doing cross-registration in [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Information Engineering in [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/).

**I'm currently applying for a Ph.D. program starting Fall 2024.**

My research mainly sits at **reinforcement learning**, **computer vision** and **computer graphics**. In my master's study, I've been working with [Prof. Daniel Ritchie](https://dritchie.github.io/) in [Brown Visual Computing](https://visual.cs.brown.edu/) group to do shape program inference with diffusion model. Besides, I've also been working with [Prof. George Konidaris](https://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/) in [Intelligent Robot Lab](http://irl.cs.brown.edu/) to explore the intersection of model-based RL and parameterized action MDP.

Before joining Brown, I also did many experiments about RL and CV in my undergraduate study. In RL, I used multi-agent DRL algorithms to allocate energy and spectrum resources for IoT devices, also used DRL to do dynamic spectrum access. In CV, I conducted several projects about detecting niduses on CT images, and identifying motions in figure skating in HPC lab of DUT. Besides, I have participated in the development of *Face Recognition based Time and Attendance System* as an algorithm engineer intern at Panasonic Corp., and *Recognition of Japanese cursive script* as an AI Lab researcher intern at Dalian Hi-think Computer Technology Corp, where I combined CNN and Transformer to detect and recognize cursive Japanese characters.
