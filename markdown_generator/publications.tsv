2022-10-10	When DSA Meets SWIPT: A Joint Power Allocation and Time Splitting Scheme Based on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning	IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology (IEEE TVT)	"Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and simultaneously wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) are two promising approaches to address the spectrum and energy supply problems. However, most existing works studied these two techniques separately, and how to effectively realize them simultaneously is non-trivial, because the power allocation of DSA and time splitting of SWIPT will influence both data transmission and energy harvesting performance. Hence, a sophisticated joint design is necessary, which, however, is challenging considering the uncertain dynamic spectrum environment. In this paper, we propose a joint power allocation and time splitting scheme to facilitate devices to implement both DSA and SWIPT simultaneously, which aims at maximizing the long-term throughput while ensuring the interference limitation and energy supply requirements. Considering the environmental uncertainty, we develop a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning solution to make each device autonomously select the best decision that could optimize the whole network performance based on its local observations. Simulation results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed scheme."	"R. Zhang, X. Li and N.

Besides, due to the fact that the domain gap inevitably exists between different datasets, which could be caused by diversified staining methods or the heterogeneous appearance of different tissues, it is almost impossible to get labelled data under all circumstances. This paper applies domain adaptation as an effective and efficient method to align two domains in latent feature space. We experiment on both IoU and Excepted Calibration Error (ECE), an indicator mostly used in biomedical segmentation to evaluate our work. In two domain adaptation tasks, i.e., TNBC and MoNuSeg, we proved that by exchanging the low frequency of two styles of the datasets, can Fourier Domain Adaptation (FDA) successfully achieve a considerable increasement of 1% and 2.29% higher than simply using source images to train with U-net in the target dataset."

However, motion-centered TAS, as an important topic, is little researched due to unavailable datasets. In order to explore more models and practical applications of motion-centered TAS, we introduce a Motion-Centered Figure Skating (MCFS) dataset in this paper. Compared with existing temporal action segmentation datasets, the MCFS dataset is fine-grained semantic, specialized and motion-centered. Besides, RGB-based and Skeleton-based features are provided in the MCFS dataset. Experimental results show that existing state-of-the-art methods are difficult to achieve excellent segmentation results (including accuracy, edit and F1 score) in the MCFS dataset. This indicates that MCFS is a challenging dataset for motion-centered TAS. The latest dataset can be downloaded at https://shenglanliu.github.io/mcfs-dataset/."

2021-02-12	An Intelligent Cost-Efficient Skipping Based Sensing Scheme for Cognitive Radio Transmissions	"National Intellectual Property Administration, PRC (China Patent)"	"Based on the continuance feature of the band¡¯s idle state observed from the result of our spectrum measurement campaign, in this paper, we propose a skipping based sensing (SBS) scheme for cognitive radio transmissions, where the sensing phase is skipped for several slots if a band is captured in the idle state, instead of sensing at each slot, so that the sensing cost could be reduced significantly. We focus on the parallel sensing scenario and consider the hardware limitation that only a portion of all available bands could be accessed. To obtain an intelligent joint decision on band selection and the number of slots to be skipped under the dynamic spectrum environment, we first develop a data-driven approach based on the partially observable Markov decision process model. Considering that the perfect knowledge on spectrum environment might be hardly obtainable in some cases, we further design a model-free reinforcement learning based method to make the decision adaptive to the spectrum dynamics. Real data is collected by using USRP-2922 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SBS scheme."
